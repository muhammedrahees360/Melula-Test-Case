# Testing Process - Manual  
Conducting manual testing for the "Melula" website on GitHub involves a hands-on, exploratory approach to scrutinize its various functionalities and user interfaces. 
Start by systematically navigating through the website, evaluating each feature and ensuring its intended behavior aligns with the project requirements. 
Test different user scenarios, input validation, and error handling to identify potential issues that might not be covered by automated testing. 
Verify the website's compatibility across multiple browsers and devices to guarantee a consistent user experience.
Manually simulate user interactions, such as form submissions, to validate data integrity and confirm that the website responds appropriately. 
Pay close attention to the visual elements, checking for design consistency and responsiveness. 
Document your findings, including any discovered bugs or areas for improvement, and provide detailed feedback on GitHub to facilitate collaboration with the development team. 
Manual testing complements automated testing by offering a personalized and in-depth examination of the website's user interface and functionality.
